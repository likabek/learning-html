<div class="yellow">
    Yellow is the color of the Sun, so we first of all associate it with warmness.
    </div>
<div class="red">
    Although, many people say that red is the most agressive color, the color of blood, but for me, red symbolizes the end of spring and summer. When I se red, I imagine how flowers bloom. 
    </div>
    
    <div class="blue">
        The sky is blue, and blue is the most romantic color for me. I can watch to the sky for hours and dream. Blue also associates with peace and blues.
    </div>
    
    <div class="pink">
        Pink reminds me about my favorite cartoon, 'Pink pantera'. This is te color of my childhood.
    </div>
