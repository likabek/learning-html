<div class="yellow">
Yellow is the color of the Sun, so we first of all associate it with warmness.
    </div>
<div class="red">
    Although, many people say that red is the most agressive color, the color of blood, but for me, red symbolizes the end of spring and summer. When I see red, I imagine how flowers bloom.
    </div>

    <div class="blue">
        The sky is blue, and blue is the most romantic color for me. I can watch to the sky for hours and dream. Blue also associates with peace and blues.
    </div>

    <div class="pink">
        Pink reminds me about my favorite cartoon, 'Pink pantera'. This is te color of my childhood.
    </div>


    <div class="green">
      Green also associates with nature, spring, freshness. Anyway, it has various
      shades, and sometimes it doesn't look good for clothes. Be carefull when
      chosing green T-shirt.
</div>
    <p>
        My favorite colors are pink and yellow. If I wear that colors, my mood will surely be high on that day.
